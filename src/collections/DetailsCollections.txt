In kotlin we have collections. They are:
- Iterator
- List
- Set
- Map (it doesn't inherit from Collection. It's not officially a collection)

A way to group elements together
Zero or more elements
Same type

Iterable means go one by one from each element in a collection

From the types of collection above I can have the mutable class of each one
- MutableIterable
- MutableList
- MutableSet
- MutableMap

-----------------------------------------

* List
Ordered collection
Elements can be accessed by the position (index)
Can contain duplicate elements
It has a specific type
[1,2,3,45,6,2,6,7,1,4,3]

* Set
Group of unique elements
The order has no significance
We can go through the elements one by one (iterate over them), but the order is not defined
[1,2,3,45,6,7,4]

* Map
A set of key-value pairs
Keys are unique (set)
Each key maps to exactly one value
Values can be duplicate
{1 = one, 3 = three, 5 = five}

* Iterator
An iterator is an object that loops through elements of a collection
Useful when applying the same operation to all elements
