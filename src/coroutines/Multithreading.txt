It's the ability to run two or more process in the same time (parallel)

Benefits:
- responsiveness (my UI will not freeze)
- faster execution (I don't need to wait the previous task to be executed to execute a second one - if they are not
depended on each other)
- parallelisation (better CPU utilisation)
- resource efficiency

Drawbacks:
- synchronization (to synchronize two or more ending executions)
- error handling

The solution Coroutine comes with the proposal to solve the drawbacks listed above.
