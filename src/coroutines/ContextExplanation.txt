Context and Scope are very similar in concept, but they are used in different ways

A context is a set of data related to the coroutine (is a set of variables that you can access inside the coroutine)

All coroutines have an associated context (when a scope creates a coroutine it automatically provides de context for
that coroutine)

-----------------------------
Scope is used to create and manage coroutines
Context is just the set of variables related to that coroutine
-----------------------------

Important elements of a context
- Dispatcher: which thread the coroutine is run on
- Job: handle on the coroutine lifecycle
